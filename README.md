PhotoGallery is the 5. Project for Treehouses Front End Web Development Techdegreee.

## Goals
The goals of this project are to create a photo-gallery that displays a grid of provided photo-thumbnails.
With the help of JS and jQuery, we had to add a light-box which shows each photo with the possibility to scroll through the whole gallery, with the caption text of each photo, when clicking on a thumbnail.
We also had to include a search-bar, which searches for a given word in the title and the caption-text of each photo.
